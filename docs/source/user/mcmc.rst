MCMC Fitting 
============

.. warning:: These functions are under construction. 

Setup
-----

1. Copy the ``config.yaml`` and ``run.py`` from the main directory to an external folder.

2. Edit your configuration script ``config.yaml``, which should look something like below.

3. In your new directory run ``python run.py`` in terminal.


Configuration
-------------

.. literalinclude:: ../../../config.yaml


Pre-MCMC Testing
----------------

To test to make sure all of the modeling modules are working, run the following command in terminal::

	python run.py make_model

which should return something like::

	[25.732014894485474s] MCMC initialization step complete.

To test by eye, that your initial MCMC parameters are some close to the data::

	python run.py test_fit


Running the MCMC
----------------

Run the MCMC::

	python run.py mcmc

Plot the outputs::

	python run.py walkers
	python run.py corner
